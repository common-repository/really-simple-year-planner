#. Description of the plugin
msgid ""
"This plugin provides a single view year planner. It is not trying to be a "
"complete diary solution or events planner, but is simply there to give you "
"all the weeks of the year arranged in a single view. The ability to add "
"coloured bars representing events in your year planner is a bonus!"
